"""Multi-class spoof fusion engine.

Combines per-analyzer scores into a probability distribution
over the 7-category spoof taxonomy.

Evidence-based weighting: analyzers with proven discrimination
power get higher weights. Analyzers that are anti-correlated
(score spoofs higher than real) get near-zero weight.

Calibration data (from analyze_captures.py ground truth test):
  MiniFASNet:       real=99.9  spoof=5.1   gap=+94.7  GOOD
  screen_replay:    real=46.7  spoof=37.1  gap=+9.6   WEAK
  device_boundary:  (new, untested — expected HIGH)
  moire:            real=39.1  spoof=44.1  gap=-5.0   ANTI-CORRELATED
  texture:          real=72.1  spoof=78.4  gap=-6.3   ANTI-CORRELATED
  temporal:         real=90.0  (single-frame only)     NEUTRAL
